Crime Prediction and Prevention Using AI
Overview

Crime patterns are often reactive rather than proactive, leading to resource strain and inefficient crime prevention. This project utilizes AI and advanced data analysis to predict high-risk areas for specific crime types, enabling targeted patrolling, resource allocation, and preventative measures. Additionally, it includes an AI chatbot for deployment planning and a dynamic dashboard for real-time data visualization.

Introduction

This project aims to harness the power of machine learning and data analysis to predict high-risk areas for various crime types. By leveraging historical crime data, the project will provide insights and visualizations to aid law enforcement agencies in deploying resources more effectively and proactively preventing crime.
Features

    Data loading and preprocessing
    Machine learning model training for crime prediction
    Visualization of high-risk areas (hotspots)
    Interactive dashboard for real-time data insights
    AI chatbot for deployment planning
    Customizable parameters for different crime types and prediction models

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crime-prediction.git
cd crime-prediction

Create and activate a virtual environment:

sh

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Load and preprocess the data:
    Ensure you have your crime data in CSV format. Update the data loading script to point to your dataset.

    Train the machine learning model:
    Customize the model training script for your specific needs and run it to train your prediction model.

    Run the dashboard:
    Start the Dash application to visualize predictions and high-risk areas.

    sh

    python app.py

    Access the dashboard:
    Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the interactive dashboard.

    Interact with the AI Chatbot:
    Use the chatbot interface in the dashboard to receive deployment recommendations and other insights.

Data

This project requires historical crime data, which should include at least the following columns:

    date: The date of the crime
    type: The type of crime
    latitude: The latitude coordinate of the crime
    longitude: The longitude coordinate of the crime
    other relevant features...

Example data can be found in the data directory.
Modeling

The project includes various machine learning models to predict crime hotspots, such as:

    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosting
    Neural Networks

Models can be customized and evaluated using scripts provided in the models directory.
Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly provides real-time insights and visualizations:

    Overview of crime statistics
    Heatmaps of predicted high-risk areas
    Detailed views for specific crime types and times

AI Chatbot

The AI chatbot assists law enforcement by providing deployment recommendations based on the predicted crime hotspots. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users and provide actionable insights.
